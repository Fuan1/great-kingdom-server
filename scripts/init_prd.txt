# Overview  
[I am planning to implement a WebSocket server that provides a game similar to Go. This will be an easy entry point for learning the basic concepts of Go. The basic description of the game is as follows:
Two players alternately place stones on a 9 * 9 grid.
Similar to Go, if a player creates a territory, the opponent cannot place stones in that area.
The player who captures at least one of the opponent's stones wins.
If a player cannot place a stone or both players request to count territories, the player with more territory wins.
]

# Core Features  
[WebSocket implementation is required for creating, deleting, entering, leaving, and matching game rooms. Socket management should maintain connections even during page navigation or brief disconnections.
The game must include a timer, and judgments such as timeout defeats or automatic losses after disconnections longer than 1 minute should be implemented.
When a game ends, the system should remove the game room and determine the winner.
The game processes must be recorded in the database.
After a game ends, player ratings should be adjusted.
Game matching is based on the ELO rating system.]

# User Experience  
[The user logs in (only Google login is supported).
The user requests game matching.
The user enjoys the game.]

# Technical Architecture  
[
    backend
    1. using nest.js
    2. Socket.IO for WebSocket communications
    3. postgresql for storing game records, user profiles, and ratings
    4. Redis for managing active games and session state
    Data Models
    1. User: Google ID, nickname, rating, game history
    2. Game: board state, player information, moves history, timestamps, result
    3. Room: active players, spectators, game state, timer information
    APIs and Integrations
    1. Google OAuth2 for authentication
    2. RESTful API for non-game functions (user profiles, game history)
    3. WebSocket endpoints for real-time game interactions
    Infrastructure
    1. Cloud-based hosting (AWS) 
    2. Monitoring for server health and game metrics
