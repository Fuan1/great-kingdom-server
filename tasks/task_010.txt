# Task ID: 10
# Title: Setup AWS Deployment and Monitoring
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
# Priority: low
# Description: Configure AWS infrastructure for hosting the application and implement monitoring for server health and game metrics.
# Details:
1. Create AWS infrastructure using Terraform or CloudFormation:
   - EC2 instances or ECS containers for application hosting
   - RDS for PostgreSQL database
   - ElastiCache for Redis
   - Load balancer for traffic distribution
   - S3 for static assets
2. Setup CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions or AWS CodePipeline
3. Configure environment variables for production
4. Implement health check endpoints
5. Setup CloudWatch for monitoring:
   - Server metrics (CPU, memory, network)
   - Application metrics (active games, users, errors)
   - Custom alarms for critical issues
6. Create dashboard for game metrics:
   - Active users
   - Games in progress
   - Average game duration
   - Rating distribution
7. Implement logging with structured format
8. Setup backup strategy for database
9. Configure auto-scaling based on load

# Test Strategy:
1. Test deployment process to staging environment
2. Verify all services connect correctly in production
3. Test load balancing with simulated traffic
4. Verify monitoring captures relevant metrics
5. Test alerts by triggering alarm conditions
6. Verify logs are properly collected and searchable
7. Test backup and restore procedures
8. Verify auto-scaling responds to load changes
